## Basic Game Physics Programming


</div>

### Description

Here's a simple demo of how to program basic physics for a flying object (like a space ship or something). It demonstrates physics for a primary object (the ship) and secondary objects (the bullets), and as always it's simple and well-commented, as well as running at 40 fps or faster. This is basically a revamped version of the Return of the Avenger game engine -also on psc- so download that to see this code actually used in a game.
